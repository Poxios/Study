# Subquery
* Subquery is called `containing statement`.
* Subquery is always located in bracket and always executes first.
* Subquery works like temp table which has `statement scope`. (Server 'free' that memory.)

```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name   
FROM customer   
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM customer)
```

## Noncorrelated Subqueries 
* Can be executed alone. 
* Most used case.
```sql
SELECT city_id, city
FROM city
WHERE country_id <>
 (SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country = ‘India’);
```
* In this case, error will be thrown when subquery returns more than one result.
* Subquery must return one result when it used with equality conditions.
```sql
SELECT country_id  
FROM country  
WHERE country IN ('Canada','Mexico');
```
* In this case, subquery can return more than one result. (with `in`, `not in` operators.)
### ALL Operator
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM customer  
WHERE customer_id <> ALL  
    (SELECT customer_id  
    FROM payment  
    WHERE amount = 0)
```
* Not recommended.
> Causion: if `NULL` is in the set, you should prevent using `not in` or `<> all` statement.
> Comparing with `NULL` always returns `unknown` result.

### Multi Column Subquery
```sql
SELECT actor_id, film_id  
FROM film_actor  
WHERE (actor_id, film_id) IN  
 (SELECT a.actor_id, f.film_id  
  FROM actor a  
     CROSS JOIN film f  
  WHERE a.last_name = 'MONROE'  
  AND f.rating = 'PG');
```
* You can use multi column by using bracket in `WHERE` clause.
