# Subquery
* Subquery is called `containing statement`.
* Subquery is always located in bracket and always executes first.
* Subquery works like temp table which has `statement scope`. (Server 'free' that memory.)

```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name   
FROM customer   
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM customer)
```
