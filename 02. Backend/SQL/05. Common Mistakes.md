# Common Mistakes
## Not Unique Primary Key
* Same as title
## Foreign Key Not Exists
* If you make the row foreign key, then that table is **child**, and table which has primary key is **parent**.
* You need to make new row to **parent** first.
## Row Data Vioation
* `SET eye_color = 'ZZ'` <- Error!
## Date Conversion Failed
* 'DEC-21-1980' <- Error!
```sql
UPDATE
    person
SET
    birth_date = str_to_date('DEC-21-1980', '%b-%d-%Y')
WHERE
    person_id = 1
```
