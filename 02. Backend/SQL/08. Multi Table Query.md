# Multi Table Query
## Inner Join
### Cross Join
* Just using `JOIN` alone.
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c JOIN address a;
```
### Inner Join
* Give relationship between two tables.
```sql
FROM customer c JOIN address a
ON c.address_id = a.address_id
```
* If any join type is not specified, `INNER JOIN` is default selected.
* But declaring join type is important because there are many join types.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c INNER JOIN address a USING (address_id);
```
* If two columns' name are same, you can use `USING` keyword.
* This is **SQL92-like statement**. Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, IBM DB2 Universial DB will understand this statement.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address 
FROM customer c, address a 
WHERE c.address_id = a.address_id;
```
* Query like this can be also accepted.
* But this type of statement is hard to understand because which line of `WHERE` clause means `JOIN` part, or else.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c, address a
WHERE c.address_id = a.address_id
  AND a.postal_code = 52137;
```
* This is SQL92-like statement, and this is easy to understand.
## Joining More Than Two Tables.
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
FROM customer c
  INNER JOIN address a
  ON c.address_id = a.address_id
  INNER JOIN city ct
  ON a.city_id = ct.city_id;
```
* Order of tables is not important.
* If joining order of table is important, use `straight_join` keyword.

## Using Subquery
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, addr.address, addr.city  
 FROM customer c  
   INNER JOIN
     (SELECT a.address_id, a.address, ct.city  
      FROM address a  
        INNER JOIN city ct  
        ON a.city_id = ct.city_id  
      WHERE a.district = 'California'  
     ) addr  
    ON c.address_id = addr.address_id;
```
