# Query Clause
* select, from, where, group by, having, order by

## Select Clause
* You can add `literal`, `expression`, `built-in function`, `user-definedfunction`.
```sql
SELECT
    language_id,
    'COMMON' language_usage,
    language_id * 3.1415927 lang_pi_value,
    upper(name) language_name
FROM
    language;
```
This is example.  
```sql
SELECT 
    version(),
    user(),
    database();
```
* You can skip from clause if you use only built-in function.
### Column Alias
* You can rename rows in `SELECT` clause.
```sql
SELECT
    'COMMON' AS language_usage,
    language_id * 3.1415927 AS lang_pi_value,
    upper(name) AS language_name
FROM
    language;
```  
Like this. (Use `AS` keyword for more clear distinction.)  

### Remove Duplicated
* `SELECT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;` <- Many same actor_ids.
* `SELECT DISTINCT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;` <- Many same actor_ids.
* Warn: `DISTINCT` may work slow because it must execute after the sorting. Avoid using `DISTINCT` for check is there any duplication.

## From Clause
* `Permanent Table`: created by `create table`
* `Derived Table`: returned by child query, and stored in memory
* `Temporary Table`: stored in memory.
* `Virtual Table`: created by `create view`

### Derived Table
```sql
SELECT
    concat(cust.last_name, ', ', cust.first_name) full_name
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            first_name,
            last_name,
            email
        FROM
            customer
        WHERE
            first_name = 'JESSIE'
    ) cust;
```
* We made `cust` drived table. Access this table with `cust.`.

### Temporary Table
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE actors_j
    (actor_id smallint(5),
    first_name varchar(45),
    last_name varchar(45)
    );
```
* Create temporary table
```sql
INSERT INTO actors_j
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE 'J%'; -- JACKMAN, JOLIE, JOHANSSON...
```

### Virtual Table (View)
* View is query saved in data dictionary.
* Works as table, but data in view not exists in real.

```sql
CREATE VIEW cust_vw AS
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, active
FROM customer;

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM cust_vw
WHERE active = 0;
```

### Connect Tables
* You need to include conditions for `Link` between tables.
```sql
SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, time(rental.rental_date) as rental_time
FROM customer INNER JOIN rental ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
WHERE date(rental.rental_date) = '2005-06-14';
```
* `INNER JOIN`: makes connection between two tables.
* `ON`: Limit range.

### Making a nickname of table.
* There are two ways to refer table outside of `from clause`.
  * `employee.emp_id`
  * Give nickname of each table and use it on entire query.
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, time(r.rental_date) rental_time
FROM customer as c
    INNER JOIN rental as r
    ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14';
```

## Where Clause
* `Where` clause can filter rows.
```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'G' AND rental_duration >= 7;
```
* You need to use parentheses to group conditions.
```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE (rating = 'G' AND rental_duration >= 7)
    OR (rating = 'PG-13' AND rental_duration < 4);
```

## 'Group by' and 'Having' Clause
```sql 
select
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    count(*)
from
    customer as c
    inner join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
group by
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
having
    count(*) >= 40;
```
* hard..
## 'Order by' Clause
* Order in query output is not guaranteed.
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, time(r.rental_date) as rental_time
FROM customer as c
    INNER JOIN rental as r
    ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14';
ORDER BY c.last_name, c.first_name desc;
```
* You can add column string more than one, for same last_name.
* You can make order descending or ascending to add `desc`, `asc` keyword.
### Order by Sequence
`ORDER BY 3 desc` means ordering by third element in `SELECT` clause.
**NOT RECOMMENDED**
