# Query Clause
* select, from, where, group by, having, order by

## Select Clause
* You can add `literal`, `expression`, `built-in function`, `user-definedfunction`.
```sql
SELECT
    language_id,
    'COMMON' language_usage,
    language_id * 3.1415927 lang_pi_value,
    upper(name) language_name
FROM
    language;
```
This is example.  
```sql
SELECT 
    version(),
    user(),
    database();
```
* You can skip from clause if you use only built-in function.
### Column Alias
* You can rename rows in `SELECT` clause.
```sql
SELECT
    'COMMON' AS language_usage,
    language_id * 3.1415927 AS lang_pi_value,
    upper(name) AS language_name
FROM
    language;
```  
Like this. (Use `AS` keyword for more clear distinction.)  

### Remove Duplicated
* `SELECT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;` <- Many same actor_ids.
* `SELECT DISTINCT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;` <- Many same actor_ids.
* Warn: `DISTINCT` may work slow because it must execute after the sorting. Avoid using `DISTINCT` for check is there any duplication.

## From Clause
* `Permanent Table`: created by `create table`
* `Derived Table`: returned by child query, and stored in memory
* `Temporary Table`: stored in memory.
* `Virtual Table`: created by `create view`

### Derived Table
```sql
SELECT
    concat(cust.last_name, ', ', cust.first_name) full_name
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            first_name,
            last_name,
            email
        FROM
            customer
        WHERE
            first_name = 'JESSIE'
    ) cust;
```
