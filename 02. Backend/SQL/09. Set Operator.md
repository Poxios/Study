# Set Operator
## Union, Intersect and Except
* Same area = `Intersect`
* All area = `Union`
* A - B = `Except`
### Union
* `Union` vs `union all`
```sql
SELECT 1 num, 'abc' str
UNION
SELECT 9 num, 'xyz' str;
```
* Result will be shown together
```sql
SELECT 'CUST' typ, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a;
```
* You can use `UNION ALL` clause like this.
* `UNION ALL` clause doesn't remove same rows even if you use `SELECT 'ACTR'` clause same.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name 
FROM customer c 
WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%' 
UNION ALL 
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name 
FROM actor a 
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
```
* You can remove duplicated rows with `UNION`.

### Intersect
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'D%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'T%'
INTERSECT
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'D%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'T%';
```
* It can't be done with MySQL 8.0.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
EXCEPT
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%';
```
* It can't be done with MySQL 8.0.

### Rules of Set Operators
* You should use `ORDER BY` keyword last line if you want to order results.
* In `Order Clause`, you need to define nickname of each columns.
* `Union` and `Union All` keywords are order-related. You should care about it.
