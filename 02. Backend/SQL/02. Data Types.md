# MySQL Data Types
## Character Data: Fixed-length vs Variable-length
* Fixed-Length: Right-pad with spaces.
* Variable-length: No-pad, but bytes will be not same.

```sql
char(20)
varchar(20) /* ORACLE DB -> must use varchar2 instead of varchar*/
```  
* char's max len: 255 bytes
* varchar's: 65,535 bytes
  
### Character set
* Latin alphabet like English -> use 1 byte for each letter.
* Japanese, Korea -> Multibyte Charactersets
* `SHOW CHARACTER SET;` -> Show all avaliable character sets.
  * maxlen > 1 means this charset is multibyte charset.
* You can choose different charset for each table.
* `varchar(20) character set latin1` <- set charset
* `create database european_sales character set latin1;` <- set mysql's default charset

### Text Data
* Want to save more than 64kb data in varchar -> You can use Text Type.

|Text Type|Max Byte Size|
|---|---|
|tinytext|255|
|text(only in mysql)|65,535|
|mediumtext|16,777,215|
|longtext|4,294,967,295|
  
* You don't need to use tinytext, text type because varchar is now accepting 65,535 size.

## Numeric Data
* Includes boolean type, default key, normal int, float
* tinyint, smallint, mediumint, int, bigint <- types for int. You can put `unsigned` front of them
* float, double <- types for float.
* float(p,s) <- p = number count for left side of dot / s = right side of that.

## Temporal Data (Time Data)
* date, datetime, timestamp, year, time
* datetime, timestamp, time <- these types support milliseconds
* Warn: Length of time data stored in DB is different for each DB services.

### Example
* Estimated delivery date: `time` type -> cannot estimated exact arrival time, and exact past time is not required.
* Exact ordering data: `datetime` type -> exact time is required.
* Time left for some work: `time` type -> Only needs time data.
