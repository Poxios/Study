# Filtering
> Edit entire rows in table after the new column added.
* No need to include `where` clause
* `<>` keyword is same as `NOT` in `WHERE` clause
### Inequality Operator
`NOT`, `<>`, `!=`

## Range Filtering
```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'FA' AND 'FRB';
```
* Instead of using `a<3 and 1<a`, use `BETWEEN` keyword.
* You can use character range with `collation rules`.

## Membership Condition
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'G' OR rating = 'PG';
```
* What if there are a lot more OR statements?
* Use this!
```sql
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG')
```

### Use Subquery
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating IN (SELECT rating FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%PET%');
```
* You can make subquery like this.
