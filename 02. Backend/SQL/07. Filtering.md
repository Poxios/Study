# Filtering
> Edit entire rows in table after the new column added.
* No need to include `where` clause
* `<>` keyword is same as `NOT` in `WHERE` clause
### Inequality Operator
`NOT`, `<>`, `!=`

## Range Filtering
```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'FA' AND 'FRB';
```
* Instead of using `a<3 and 1<a`, use `BETWEEN` keyword.
* You can use character range with `collation rules`.

## Membership Condition
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'G' OR rating = 'PG';
```
* What if there are a lot more OR statements?
* Use this!
```sql
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG')
```
* You can use `NOT IN`

### Use Subquery
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating IN (SELECT rating FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%PET%');
```
* You can make subquery like this.

## Matching Conditions
```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE left(last_name,1) = 'Q'
```
* Using `left` build-in func is not recommended.
* Using wildcard is recommended.
### Wildcard Characters
`_`: Exactly one char.  
`%`: All strings regardless of number of chars.  
* You need to use `like` keyword when using wildcard searching.
```sql
WHERE last_name LIKE '_A_T%S';
```
* You can use `LIKE` statement more than one.
```sql
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Q%' OR last_name LIKE 'Y%';
```
* This clause will search names starts with Q and Y both.

### Regular Expression
```sql
WHERE last_name REGEXP '^[QY]';
```

## Null
> Not applicable (employee ID when withdrawing money at ATM)
> Value not yet known
> Value undefined
```sql
SELECT rental_id, customer_id
FROM rental
WHERE return_date IS NULL;
```
* You must use `IS NULL` keyword to search row is null.
* `WHERE return_date = NULL` is not working!!

```sql
WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL;
```

### MUST-KNOW
If you use `NOT BETWEEN IN` statement, `null` fields are not be in there.
```sql
SELECT rental_id, customer_id, return_date  
FROM rental  
WHERE return_date IS NULL  
  OR return_date NOT BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND '2005-09-01';
```
* You must use like this.
