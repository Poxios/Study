# Grouping and Aggregate
## What is Grouping?
```sql
SELECT customer_id FROM rental;
```
* Many duplication in this case.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
FROM rental  
GROUP BY customer_id;
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
* count(*) column prints total count of `GROUP BY` clause.
* `ORDER BY` clause orders by count(*).
* You cannot use `WHERE count(*) >= 40` clause because `GROUP BY` clause executes after `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, count(*)
FROM rental  
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) >= 40;
```

## Aggregation
* max, min, avg, sum, count
```sql
SELECT MAX(amount) max_amt,
   MIN(amount) min_amt,
   AVG(amount) avg_amt,
   SUM(amount) tot_amt,
   COUNT(*) num_payments
 FROM payment;
```

### Explicit / Implicit Group
* Without `GROUP BY` clause, it is **implicit group**.
```sql
SELECT customer_id
  MAX(amount) max_amt
  MIN(amount) min_amt
  AVG(amount) avg_amt
  SUM(amount) tot_amt
  COUNT(*) num_payments 
FROM payment;
```
* Error: you have to `GROUP BY` clause.

### Calculate Distinct Values
```sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) num_rows,  
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) num_customers  
FROM payment;
```
* Only unique customer_id will be counted.

```sql
SELECT MAX(datediff(return_date,rental_date))
FROM rental;
```

### Handling Null
Warning: If column has `null` value row, count(*) will count that row but count(val) doesn't.

### Grouping Single Column
```sql
SELECT actor_id, count(*) 
FROM film_actor 
GROUP BY actor_id;
```

### Grouping Multi Columns
```sql
SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*) 
FROM film_actor fa 
  INNER JOIN film f 
  ON fa.film_id = f.film_id 
GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating 
ORDER BY 1,2;
```

### Grouping and Expressions
```sql
SELECT extract(YEAR FROM rental_date) year,    
  COUNT(*) how_many    
FROM rental    
GROUP BY extract(YEAR FROM rental_date);
```
* You can use `GROUP BY` with functions.

### With ROLLUP / CUBE
```sql
SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)   
FROM film_actor fa   
  INNER JOIN film f   
  ON fa.film_id = f.film_id   
GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating WITH ROLLUP   
ORDER BY 1,2;
```
* PASS

### Use Filter on Group
```sql
SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*) 
FROM film_actor fa 
    INNER JOIN film f 
    ON fa.film_id = f.film_id 
WHERE f.rating IN ('G','PG') 
GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating 
HAVING count(*) > 9;
```
* Use `HAVING` clause to use filtering on group.

> Want to filter on original data -> Use `WHERE`
> Want to filter on grouped data -> Use `HAVING`
